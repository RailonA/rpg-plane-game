# rpg-plane-game

> This project is a capstone project required by Microverse, after completing the javascript curriculum. This game is built with JS ES6 and Phaser3.

## Features

1. The player can navigate to the following scenes after the game loads
`Credits`: This is where we give credits to the Microverse team, opengameart, and the creator of the game.
`Options`: We can toggle the background music on/off.
`Play`: We navigate the guide scene and understand how to play the game before proceeding.
2. A player can fire a laser to kill the enemy attacking.
3. The enemy can also fire laser and kill the player.

## Future Feature (v2.02)

1. Improve the UI
2. Add more levels to the game
3. Each level should have a more attacking enemy

## Game Design Process (GDD)

At the end of day 2, I have learned the basics of Phaser3. Setting up and creating scenes, adding objects to the scenes, adding collision
and assets to the scenes.
The rest of the days are for the following:
- Implement the logic behind the game.
- Implement the service API to record and show user name and score.
- Implement test for our Model and API
