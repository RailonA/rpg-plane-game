<b>Shooter Game - Air Plane Game</b> The main goal of this project is to understand the benefits of modularized code as well as the ability to set up a javascript application made of different modules using webpack and more advanced ES6 features.

## Rules

- Use direction keys to move the player 
- Escape the enemy and while destroying as many of them as possible
- You choose to submit your score to be ranked among other players

### Prerequisites

- JavaScript ES6
- Text Editor
- Git
- NodeJS
- Webpack


## Features

1. The player can navigate to the following scenes after the game loads
`Credits`: This is where we give credits to the Microverse team, opengameart, and the creator of the game.
`Options`: We can toggle the background music on/off.
`Play`: We navigate the guide scene and understand how to play the game before proceeding.
`Score` : Displays the top five high scores.
2. A player can fire a laser to kill the enemy attacking.
3. The enemy can also fire laser and kill the player.
4. Player can also lose by colliding with the enemy ship.  

## Future Feature (v2.02)

1. Improve the UI
2. Add more levels to the game
3. Each level should have a more enemy and challanges

## Game Design Process (GDD)

At the end of day 2, I have learned the basics of Phaser3. Setting up and creating scenes, adding objects to the scenes, adding collision and assets to the scenes.
The rest of the days are for the following:
- Implement the logic behind the game.
- Implement the service API to record and show user name and score.
- Implement test for our Model and API
